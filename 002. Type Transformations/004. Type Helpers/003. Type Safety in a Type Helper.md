Let's say we want to create a Type Helper that takes a string and then adds a "/" prefix to it.

If we use the knowledge from the previous section, we can maybe do -

    type AddRoutePrefix<TRoute> = `/${TRoute}`;

But, we will see that this gives us an error -

    Type 'TRoute' is not assignable to type 'string | number | bigint | boolean | null | undefined'

    This type parameter might need an `extends string | number | bigint | boolean | null | undefined` constraint.

Remember that if you do not give any constraints to a Type Parameter, it will be of type 'unknown' by default in a Generic Type.

We know that in our case, only a string should be passed to 'AddRoutePrefix'.

So, how do we tell TypeScript that 'TRoute' will always be a string?

That's where we can use the 'extends' keyword in TypeScript.

The 'extends' keyword allows us to add constraints to Type Parameters. So, we can tell TypeScript that 'TRoute' will always be a string by doing -

    type AddRoutePrefix<TRoute extends string> = `/${TRoute}`;\

Here, we are telling TypeScript that 'TRoute' can only be a type that is assignable to 'string'.
