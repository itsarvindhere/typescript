So far, we have created Type Helpers with a single Type Parameter. But that is not always the case. Sometimes, we may need to create Type Helpers that take multiple Type Parameters.

For example, what if we want to create a type helper that takes two types - one for data and one for error, and then creates a shape for an API response?

Well, we can do that by defining multiple Type Parameters in our Type Helper.

Let's say our Type Helper is called 'CreateDataShape' -

    type CreateDataShape = {
        data: unknown;
        error: unknown;
    };

Right now, this is not a reusable Type Helper because it always uses 'unknown' for both 'data' and 'error'. We want it to be dynamic so that the user can specify the types for 'data' and 'error'.

As we know, we can do that by adding Type Parameters to our Type Helper. So, we can modify 'CreateDataShape' to take two Type Parameters - 'TData' and 'TError' -

    type CreateDataShape<TData, TError> = {
        data: TData;
        error: TError;
    };

Now, 'CreateDataShape' is a reusable Type Helper that can take any two types for 'data' and 'error'.

So, we can call it any way we want -

    type UserDataShape = CreateDataShape<{ name: string; age: number }, string>;
    type ProductDataShape = CreateDataShape<{ id: number; title: string }, null>;
