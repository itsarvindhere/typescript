In the last section, we learned how to use the 'Extract' utility type to filter types from a union based on their assignability to another type. Now, let's explore the complementary utility type called 'Exclude'.

What if we want to create a new type that excludes certain types from a union? This is where 'Exclude' comes into play. The syntax is -

    type Exclude<T, U> = T extends U ? never : T;

The 'Exclude' utility type constructs a type by excluding from union 'T' all types that are assignable to union 'U'.

So, let's take the same example as last time, where we have a discriminated union of events -

    type MyEvent = 
        | {
            type: 'click';
            event: 'MouseEvent';
        }
        | {
            type: 'keydown';
            event: 'KeyboardEvent';
        }
        | {
            type: 'focus';
            event: 'FocusEvent';
        };

What if we want to get all the events except for the 'keydown' events. That is, we want all the non 'keydown' events from the 'MyEvent' union.

We can use the 'Exclude' utility type like this -

    type NonKeydownEvent = Exclude<MyEvent, { type: 'keydown' }>;

This will give us -

    type NonKeydownEvent = {
        type: "click";
        event: "MouseEvent";
    } | {
        type: "focus";
        event: "FocusEvent";
    }

So, by providing '{ type: 'keydown' }' as the second type parameter, TypeScript goes through each member of the 'MyEvent' union and excludes those that extend the provided type.

This is basically the opposite of what we did with 'Extract'.
