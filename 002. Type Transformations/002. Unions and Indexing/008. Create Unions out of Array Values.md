Let's say we have an array -

    const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] as const;;

This is an array of literal strings, but what if we want to create a union type out of the values in this array?

We want something like -

    type AppleOrBanana = "apple" | "banana";
    type Fruit = "apple" | "banana" | "cherry";

In case of objects, we can use the 'Indexed Access Types' to achieve this. In case of objects, we pass a union of keys to get a union of values.

But what about arrays?

Well, we can use 'Indexed Access Types' here as well. But instead of passing keys, we can pass the index of the specific value or values.

So, let's say I want the type of the first value -

    type FirstFruit = typeof fruits[0];

Similarly, if I want the type of the second and third values -

    type SecondAndThirdFruits = typeof fruits[1 | 2];

What if I want the type of all the values in the array?

    type Fruit = typeof fruits[0 | 1 | 2];

This works. But, suppose if we have an array with a lot of values, it would be tedious to manually write all the indices.

That's where we can do -

    type Fruit = typeof fruits[number];

This works because we know that all the indices (0, 1, 2) are numbers and all are assignable to a wider type 'number'.

And now, 'Fruit' will be of type "apple" | "banana" | "cherry".

And so, our final logic will be like -

    type AppleOrBanana = typeof fruits[0 | 1]
    type Fruit =  typeof fruits[number];
