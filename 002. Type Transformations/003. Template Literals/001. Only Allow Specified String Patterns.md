Let's say we have a function -

    const goToRoute = (route: unknown) => {};

This function should only accept string patterns that start with a forward slash ('/').

We can achieve this by using TypeScript's template literal types.

Just like Template Literals in JavaScript, TypeScript allows us to create types using template literal syntax.

So, we can say -

    type Route = `/${string}`;

Here, we define a type 'Route' that represents any string starting with a '/' followed by any sequence of characters. Now, we can update our function to use this type -

    const goToRoute = (route: Route) => {};

Now, all of these are valid calls -

    goToRoute('/home');
    goToRoute('/about/us');
    goToRoute('/products/123');

But, these are not valid and will result in a TypeScript error -

    goToRoute('home');
    goToRoute('about/us');
    goToRoute('products/123');
