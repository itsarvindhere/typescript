Let's take a similar example as the previous section.

    type Action = 'log_in' | 'log_out' | 'sign_up';

We want to create a new object type whose keys are the same as the values of 'Action' and the type of value is boolean. As we know already, we can use a 'Record' type to do this -

    type Object = Record<Action, boolean>;

This will give us -

    type Object = {
        log_in: boolean;
        log_out: boolean;
        sign_up: boolean;
    }

But, now, our next requirement is that we want the keys to be in uppercase like this -

    type Object = {
        LOG_IN: boolean;
        LOG_OUT: boolean;
        SIGN_UP: boolean;
    }

How do we achieve that using TypeScript's type system?

Well, we can another built-in utility type called 'Uppercase'. It simply accepts a string type and transforms it to uppercase. So, we can use it like this -

    type Object = Record<Uppercase<Action>, boolean>;

And now, 'Object' will be of the desired type -

    type Object = {
        LOG_IN: boolean;
        LOG_OUT: boolean;
        SIGN_UP: boolean;
    }

And just like 'Uppercase', there are other similar utility types like 'Lowercase' and 'Capitalize' that can be used to transform string literal types.
