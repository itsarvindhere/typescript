Typescript is just a superset of JavaScript that adds some extra features to the language. It is designed to help developers write more robust and maintainable code by introducing static typing, interfaces, and other features that are not present in JavaScript.

When we write Typescript, eventually it will be converted to JavaScript so that it can run in the browser or on a server. This conversion is done by the TypeScript compiler, which takes TypeScript code and produces equivalent JavaScript code.

So you may ask, why should I use TypeScript instead of just writing JavaScript? The answer is that TypeScript can help catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime, making it easier to find and fix bugs before they cause problems in your application. It also provides better tooling support, such as autocompletion and type checking, which can improve developer productivity.

In case of Javascript, we can write code without defining types, and the JavaScript engine will interpret it at runtime. The issue is that this can lead to runtime errors that are difficult to debug. We won't know what's wrong until the code is executed, which can make it hard to find and fix issues.

With Typescript, we can define types for our variables, function parameters, and return values. This allows the TypeScript compiler to check our code for type errors before it runs. If we try to use a variable in a way that is not compatible with its type, the compiler will give us an error, helping us catch potential issues early in the development process.

The biggest benefit of working with Typescript is the tooling support it provides. Many modern IDEs and text editors have built-in support for TypeScript, which means they can provide features like autocompletion, type checking, and inline documentation. This can make it easier to write code and understand how different parts of your application work together.

So, the bottom-line is, if you have a choice between writing JavaScript and TypeScript, you should consider using TypeScript. It can help you write more reliable and maintainable code, catch errors early in the development process, and improve your overall productivity as a developer.

# HOW IS TYPESCRIPT COMPILED TO JAVASCRIPT?

When you write JavaScript code, this is what basically happens - 

    1. You write JavaScript code.
    2. The JavaScript engine (like V8 in Chrome) interprets the code.
    3. The engine executes the code directly in the browser or on the server.

That's it. There is no extra step involved. The JavaScript engine interprets the code and executes it directly.

When you write TypeScript code, the process is slightly different - 

    1. You write TypeScript code.
    2. Your code is watched by the TypeScript's IDE server. This is what gives you autocomplete, warnings, errors and more inside the IDE when you write code in TypeScript.
    3. The TypeScript compiler (tsc) compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript code.
    4. The JavaScript engine interprets the compiled JavaScript code.
    5. The engine executes the code directly in the browser or on the server.

So, there is an extra step involved when you write TypeScript code. The TypeScript compiler takes your TypeScript code and converts it into JavaScript code that can be executed by the JavaScript engine.
