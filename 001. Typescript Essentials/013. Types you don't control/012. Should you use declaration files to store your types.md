In this section so far, we saw how declaration files can be used to describe types for libraries that don't have built-in TypeScript support. However, the question arises: should you use declaration files to store your own types in your projects?

Because, if we have a project written in TypeScript, we will definitely be having some custom types defined. And after we know about declaration files, it might seem like a good idea to put all those types in '.d.ts' files.

But, this isn't generally recommended.

Usually, the declaration files are used to put something in the global scope. Yes we can change that using the 'export' and 'import' keywords, but that is not the intended use case for declaration files.

So, in our own code, if we intend to put our custom types in separate files, it's better to use regular '.ts' files for that. This also ensures that they are type checked because in most of the projects, the 'skipLibCheck' compiler option is set to 'true' to speed up the compilation process by skipping type checking of declaration files. So, if we put our custom types in declaration files, they might not get type checked at all. Ideally, we want our own code to be type checked to catch any potential issues early.

Usually, anything that is supposed to be a module in typescript should be in a '.ts' file. Declaration files are more suited for the consumers of our libraries to get type information and also for describing the shape of libraries that we don't control.
