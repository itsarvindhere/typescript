We discussed how we can add type definitions for libraries that do not have their own type definitions.

We also discussed how we can integrate TypeScript with node.js by installing the '@types/node' package, which provides type definitions for the Node.js standard library.

Now, what about those libraries that do have their own type definitions shipped with them?

Let's say we install the 'zod' library, which is a popular schema validation library that comes with its own type definitions -

    npm install zod

Now, if you go into the 'node_modules/zod' folder, you will see a file named 'index.d.ts', which contains the type definitions for the 'zod' library.

So, if we have code -

    import { z } from 'zod';

    const user = z.object({
        name: z.string(),
    });

There won't be any errors related to types, because the 'zod' library already provides its own type definitions.

So, in such cases, we do not have to install any additional type definitions.

TypeScript is smart enough to pick up these type definitions automatically when we import the library in our code. You just need to ensure that 'moduleResolution' in your 'tsconfig.json' is set correctly (usually to 'node' or 'nodenext') so that TypeScript can locate the type definitions in the 'node_modules' folder.
