We already saw how we can modify the global scope in TypeScript by adding new properties to existing interfaces. But what if we want to add type definitions for an external library that doesn't have its own TypeScript types?

Let's say we install a library called 'x' and this library doesn't come with TypeScript type definitions.

Let's say we have this code -

    import x from 'x';

    x.doSomething();

If the package does not include type definitions, TypeScript will throw an error saying it cannot find a module declaration for 'x'.

And in such cases, you can try to find type definitions for the library in the 'DefinitelyTyped' repository. These type definitions are usually available as separate packages with names starting with '@types/'.

So, what is this 'DefinitelyTyped' repository?

Well, it is a massive collection of TypeScript type definitions for popular JavaScript libraries that do not have built-in TypeScript support. The community maintains these type definitions, and they are hosted on GitHub. As soon as you install the type definitions for a library, TypeScript will automatically pick them up and use them for type checking, given that the types are installed under node_modules/@types.
