We saw how the Classes and Enums in TypeScript can be used to create both values and types. 

Something similar happens with the 'this' keyword in TypeScript.

Let's say we have -

    class CanvasNode {
        x: number;
        y: number;

        constructor(x: number, y: number) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }

        move(x: number, y: number) {
            this.x += x;
            this.y += y;
            return this;
        }
    }

Here, the function 'move' updates the 'x' and 'y' coordinates of the CanvasNode instance and then returns 'this'. That is, it returns the current instance of the class.

If you do not know, we usually return 'this' so that we can chain multiple method calls together. For example -

    const node = new CanvasNode(0, 0);
    node.move(5, 5).move(10, 10).move(-2, 3);

Anyways, how can we define its return type? Well, one way is to use the class name itself -

    move(x: number, y: number): CanvasNode {
        this.x += x;
        this.y += y;
        return this;
    }

But, do you know we can also do this -

    move(x: number, y: number): this {
        this.x += x;
        this.y += y;
        return this;
    }

Yep, we can use 'this' as a type in TypeScript. It refers to the type of the current class instance.
