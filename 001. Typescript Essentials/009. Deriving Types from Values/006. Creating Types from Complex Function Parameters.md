How can we get the types of the parameters of a function in TypeScript?

Let's say we have this function -

    const makeQuery = (
        url?: string, 
        opts?: {
            method?: string;
            headers?: {[key: string]: string},
            body?: string
        }
    ) => {}

Here, the first parameter has a type string, and the second parameter is an object with optional properties method, headers, and body.

So, how do we get the types of these parameters in some other type? We might want some sort of an array with the types of these parameters.

There is a built-in utility type called 'Parameters' that does exactly this. This is a utility type which constructs a 'tuple' type from the types used in the parameters of a function type. Remember that it only works on function 'types', not on 'values'.

So, we cannot write -

    type MakeQueryParameters = Parameters<makeQuery>; // This will give an error

Instead, we have to use the 'typeof' operator to get the type of the function value -

    type MakeQueryParameters = Parameters<typeof makeQuery>;

And if you hover over the 'MakeQueryParameters' type, you will see that it is equivalent to -

    type MakeQueryParameters = [
        url?: string | undefined, 
        opts?: {
            method?: string | undefined;
            headers?: {
                [key: string]: string;
            } | undefined;
            body?: string | undefined;
        } | undefined
    ]

So, it gave us a tuple, where the first element is of type string | undefined, and the second element is of the complex object type we had defined.
