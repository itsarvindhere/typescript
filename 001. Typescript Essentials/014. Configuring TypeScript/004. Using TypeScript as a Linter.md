So far, we have see how we can use TypeScript not just to type check our code but also to emit JavaScript code after transpilation.

But, what if we are using a different tool for transpilation like Babel or SWC, and we just want to use TypeScript for type checking and linting our code?

So, how do use TypeScript just for linting?

Because if we run -

    tsc --watch

It will not only type check our code but also emit JavaScript files after transpilation on each change we make to our TypeScript files.

There is an option in 'tsconfig.json' called 'noEmit' which, when set to true, tells TypeScript to skip the emission of JavaScript files after transpilation.

We can also write a script in 'package.json' to run TypeScript in watch mode without emitting JavaScript files -

    "scripts": {
        "tsc:watch": "tsc --watch --noEmit"
    }

This way, we can use TypeScript purely as a linter to catch type errors and other issues in our code without generating any output files when we run this script. But, if you have a tsconfig.json file, you can simply run tsc --watch without needing to specify the --noEmit flag each time and just set "noEmit": true in the tsconfig.json file itself.

Also, if 'noEmit' is true, it makes sense to remove the 'outDir' option from 'tsconfig.json' since we are not generating any output files. Otherwise, TypeScript will still create the output directory even though no files are being emitted.
