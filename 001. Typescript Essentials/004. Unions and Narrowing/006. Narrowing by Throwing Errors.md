Let's say we have this line -

    const testElement = document.getElementById('test');

What if we want to ensure that testElement is always present before we do anything else after this line? Because at this moment, if you hover over 'testElement' variable, it will have a type as HTMLElement | null, meaning it is possible that the element with id 'test' does not exist in the DOM.

What if we do not even want our app to run further if the element is not present?

Well, we can simply throw an error if the element is not found.

    if (!testElement) {
        throw new Error('Element with id "test" not found');
    }

And now, testElement is guaranteed to be of type HTMLElement, so we can use it without any further checks. This is how we can do narrowing by throwing errors.
