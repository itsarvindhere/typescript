We can use some access modifiers in TypeScript to control the visibility of class members (properties and methods). The three access modifiers available in TypeScript are 'public', 'private', and 'protected'.

# PUBLIC

This is the default access modifier in TypeScript. When a class member is declared as 'public', it can be accessed from anywhere, both inside and outside the class. For example -

    class CanvasNode {
        public x: number;
        public y: number;

        constructor(x: number, y: number) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }
    }

    const node = new CanvasNode(10, 20);
    console.log(node.x); // 10
    console.log(node.y); // 20

Because public is already the default visibility modifier, you donâ€™t ever need to write it on a class member, but might choose to do so for style/readability reasons.

# PROTECTED

The 'protected' access modifier allows a class member to be accessed within the class itself and by any subclasses (derived classes). However, it cannot be accessed from outside the class hierarchy. We will discuss class inheritance in detail later and also the 'protected' access modifier.

# PRIVATE

The 'private' access modifier restricts the visibility of a class member to within the class itself. It cannot be accessed from outside the class or by any subclasses. This is useful for encapsulating implementation details and preventing direct access to certain properties or methods.

We learnt about 'getters' and 'setters' previously. Let's see how we can use 'private' access modifier along with them.

    class CanvasNode {
        private _x: number;
        private _y: number;

        constructor(x: number, y: number) {
            this._x = x;
            this._y = y;
        }

        get position(): { x: number; y: number } {
            return {
                x: this._x,
                y: this._y
            }
        }

        set position(position: { x: number; y: number }) {
            if (position.x >= 0) {
                this._x = position.x;
            } else {
                throw new Error("X coordinate cannot be negative");
            }

            if (position.y >= 0) {
                this._y = position.y;
            } else {
                throw new Error("Y coordinate cannot be negative");
            }
        }
    }

Here, we have defined the properties '_x' and '_y' as private. This means they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. Instead, we have provided 'getter' and 'setter' methods to access and modify these properties.

    const node = new CanvasNode(10, 20);
    console.log(node.position); // { x: 10, y: 20 }
    node.position = { x: 15, y: 25 }; // Valid
    console.log(node.position); // { x: 15, y: 25 }
    node.position = { x: -5, y: 25 }; // Throws an error: X coordinate cannot be negative

There is also a 'JavaScript' way of making the class properties private by prefixing them with a '#' symbol. This is a more recent addition to the language and is supported in TypeScript as well. The properties prefixed with '#' are truly private and cannot be accessed from outside the class.

You might want to use this one instead of the 'private' access modifier because the latter is only enforced at compile time by TypeScript. Once the code is transpiled to JavaScript, the 'private' properties can still be accessed from outside the class. However, the '#' prefixed properties are enforced at runtime by JavaScript itself and cannot be accessed from outside the class.

    class CanvasNode {
        #x: number;
        #y: number;

        constructor(x: number, y: number) {
            this.#x = x;
            this.#y = y;
        }

        get position(): { x: number; y: number } {
            return {
                x: this.#x,
                y: this.#y
            }
        }

        set position(position: { x: number; y: number }) {
            if (position.x >= 0) {
                this.#x = position.x;
            } else {
                throw new Error("X coordinate cannot be negative");
            }

            if (position.y >= 0) {
                this.#y = position.y;
            } else {
                throw new Error("Y coordinate cannot be negative");
            }
        }
    }
