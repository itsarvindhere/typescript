In TypeScript classes, we can also have members (properties and methods) that belong to the class itself rather than to any specific instance of the class. These are called static members and are defined using the 'static' keyword.

But, why would we need static members? Static members are useful for defining utility functions or constants that are related to the class but do not require an instance of the class to be used. For example, we might have a static method that calculates the distance between two points, or a static property that defines a default value for a certain property.

For example -

    class Circle {
        static PI: number = 3.14; // Static property

        radius: number;

        constructor(radius: number) {
            this.radius = radius;
        }

        static calculateArea(radius: number): number { // Static method
            return Circle.PI * radius * radius;
        }
    }

Here, we have a static property 'PI' that defines the value of pi, and a static method 'calculateArea' that calculates the area of a circle given its radius. We can access these static members using the class name, like this:

    console.log(Circle.PI); // Output: 3.14
    console.log(Circle.calculateArea(5)); // Output: 78.5

The reason why we made 'PI' and 'calculateArea' static is that they do not depend on any specific instance of the 'Circle' class. Instead, they are related to the class as a whole and can be used without creating an instance of the class.

It is worth mentioning that if we have a 'static' method, then we cannot access the instance members (non-static members) of the class inside that static method. We can only access other static members of the class.

This is what we are doing above with 'Circle.PI' inside the 'calculateArea' static method. If we try to access 'this.radius' inside the 'calculateArea' method, we will get an error - 

    static calculateArea(): number {
        return Circle.PI * this.radius * this.radius; // ERROR - Property 'radius' does not exist on type 'typeof Circle'
    }

But, if the 'calculateArea' method was not static, then we could access 'this.radius' inside that method. And we could also access 'Circle.PI' inside that non-static method.

        calculateArea(): number {
            return Circle.PI * this.radius * this.radius; // NO ERROR
        }

The 'static' members can have the same access modifiers (public, private, protected, readonly) as the instance members. By default, the static members are 'public'.

So, if a 'static' member is marked as 'private', then it can only be accessed within the class itself. If it is marked as 'protected', then it can be accessed within the class and its subclasses.
