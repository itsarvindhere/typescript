Let's say we need to have a 'position' property in our class which, when accessed, returns the x and y coordinates as an object. We should be able to call it like this -

    node.property

Well, we can achieve this using getter methods in TypeScript.

What are getter methods? They are special methods that allow us to define a property that is computed dynamically when accessed. We can define a getter method using the 'get' keyword followed by the method name.

So, for our use case, we can define a getter method called 'position' that returns an object containing the x and y coordinates -

    get position(): { x: number; y: number } {
        return { x: this.x, y: this.y };
    }

The benefit of this approach is that we can access the 'position' property like a regular property, but it is computed dynamically when accessed. This allows us to encapsulate the logic for computing the position within the class itself. When we use it, we do not have to call it like a method (i.e., with parentheses). Instead, we can access it like a regular property.

    const node = new CanvasNode(10, 20);
    node.position; // { x: 10, y: 20 }

# SETTER METHODS

Just like we have 'getter' methods, we can also have 'setter' methods. Setter methods allow us to define a property that can be set dynamically when assigned a value. We can define a setter method using the 'set' keyword followed by the method name.

Like 'getter' methods, we do not call them like regular methods with parentheses. Instead, we assign a value to them like a regular property. For example -

    class Counter {
        private _count = 0;

        get count(): number { // Getter to access the count value
            return this._count;
        }

        set count(value: number) { // Setter to update the count value
            if (value >= 0) {
                this._count = value;
            } else {
                throw new Error("Count cannot be negative");
            }
        }
    }

# THINGS TO NOTE

When we have a 'getter' method that returns some property value, but there is no corresponding 'setter' method, then that property is considered read-only. This means we can access the property value, but we cannot modify it directly.

Moreover, if there is a setter method that accepts a parameter and we have not specified the type of that parameter, then TypeScript will infer the type of that parameter based on the return type of the corresponding getter method. If the 'getter' method does not exist, then the parameter type will be inferred as 'any'.
