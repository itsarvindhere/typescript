There is a special syntax that TypeScript offers us to create and initialize class properties directly from the constructor parameters. This feature is called "Parameter Properties".

Without this feature, we would do something like this -

    class CanvasNode {
        x: number;
        y: number;

        constructor(x: number, y: number) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }

        move(x: number, y: number) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }

        get position() {
            return { x: this.x, y: this.y };
        }
    }

But, TypeScript actually lets us do something like this -

    class CanvasNode {
        constructor(private x: number, private y: number) {} <- PARAMETER PROPERTIES

        move(x: number, y: number) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }

        get position() {
            return { x: this.x, y: this.y };
        }
    }

Woah! What just happened? 

By adding the 'private' keyword in front of the constructor parameters, TypeScript automatically creates class properties with the same name and type, and initializes them with the values passed to the constructor. This saves us from writing boilerplate code.

And we can use prefixes including 'public', 'private', 'protected', and 'readonly' with parameter properties, just like we do with regular class properties.
