Let's say we have a tuple type -

    type Coordinate = [number, number];

And we have a variable of that type -

    const myHouse: Coordinate = [10, 20];

If we have a function that accepts a mutable tuple or a mutable array -

    const dangerousFunction = (numbers: number[]) => { 
        numbers.pop();
        numbers.pop();
    };

At this point, we can pass the 'myHouse' tuple in this function which might not be what we want because it will mutate the original tuple -

    dangerousFunction(myHouse);
    console.log(myHouse[2]); // Output: undefined

So, in this case, it makes sense that our 'myHouse' tuple is read-only.

Well, we can do this by using the 'readonly' modifier -

    type Coordinate = readonly [number, number];

And now if we try to pass the 'myHouse' tuple to the 'dangerousFunction', we will get a type error -

    Argument of type 'Coordinate' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number[]'.
        The type 'Coordinate' is 'readonly' and cannot be assigned to the mutable type 'number[]'.

Now, TypeScript sees that 'myHouse' is a read-only tuple and prevents us from passing it to a function that expects a mutable array.
