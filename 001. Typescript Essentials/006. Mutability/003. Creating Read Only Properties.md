Sometimes, we are dealing with types where we want to make sure some properties cannot be changed.

Let's say we have a type 'User' -

    interface User {
        id: number;
        name: string;
        age: number;
    }

And we have a method named 'updateUser' which takes in a user object and updates it.

    function updateUser(user: User) {
        user.name = "New Name"; // this is allowed
        user.age = 25; // this is allowed

        user.id = 10; // this should not be allowed
    }

Ideally, we should not let the 'id' property be changed. Because an 'id' is something that should be immutable. So, how to enforce that? 

One way is to use the 'readonly' modifier -

    interface User {
        readonly id: number;
        name: string;
        age: number;
    }

Now, if we try to change the 'id' property, TypeScript will throw an error -

    Cannot assign to 'id' because it is a read-only property.

Now, keep in mind that 'readonly' is a TypeScript feature, not a JavaScript feature. So, at runtime, the property can still be changed. But during development, TypeScript will help us catch these mistakes.
