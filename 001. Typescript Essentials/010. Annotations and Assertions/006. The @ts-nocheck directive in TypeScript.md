There is actually as way using which we can completely remove type checking from a particular file. This is done using the '@ts-nocheck' directive. As the name suggests, this directive tells the TypeScript compiler to not perform any type checking on the file in which it is present.

    // @ts-nocheck
    const handleFormData = (e: SubmitEvent) => {
        e.preventDefault();

        const data = new FormData(e.target);
        const value = Object.fromEntries(data.entries());

        return value;
    }

Now, this might be useful in a handful of scenarios, for example, when migrating a JavaScript codebase to TypeScript but I do not recommend using this directive in your TypeScript files as it completely defeats the purpose of using TypeScript in the first place.
