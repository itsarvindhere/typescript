So far, we have learnt how we can suppress some TypeScript errors using type assertions and type annotations.

Let's say we have this code -

    const handleFormData = (e: SubmitEvent) => {
        e.preventDefault();

        const data = new FormData(e.target);
        const value = Object.fromEntries(data.entries());

        return value;
    }

This code will throw an error on the line where we create a new 'FormData' object. This is because the 'e.target' is of type 'EventTarget', which is a more generic type and does not have all the properties that a form element would have.

Now, we have seen how we can fix this error using the 'as' keyword for type assertions  - 

    const handleFormData = (e: SubmitEvent) => {
        e.preventDefault();

        const data = new FormData(e.target as HTMLFormElement);
        const value = Object.fromEntries(data.entries());

        return value;
    }

But, there is another way to suppress the error on this line and that is to use the '@ts-ignore' directive.

This was introduced back in TypeScript 2.6 and basically, if we want to not see any error in some line, we can just add one comment above that line and TypeScript will ignore any error on that line. This is how it works -

    const handleFormData = (e: SubmitEvent) => {
        e.preventDefault();

        // @ts-ignore
        const data = new FormData(e.target);
        const value = Object.fromEntries(data.entries());

        return value;
    }

So, as you can see, we just added a comment '// @ts-ignore' above the line where we wanted to ignore the error and now, TypeScript will not show any error on that line.

Of course, this is only to suppress the error and it is not a fix. So, use this only when you are sure that the code will work as expected and you just want to ignore the error for some reason.

When we use it, we can also make some mistakes like misspelling and there won't be any error shown for that. For example -

    // @ts-ignore
    const data = new FormData(e.terget); // 'target' is misspelled as 'terget'

So, here, we have misspelled 'target' as 'terget' and there won't be any error shown for that because we have used the '@ts-ignore' directive above it.

Now, since all we want to suppress is the error on 'e.target', we can also do that like this -

    const data = new FormData(
        // @ts-ignore
        e.target
    );

But again, this means, any misspelling or mistake in the line will not be shown as an error.

In this case, 'as any' or 'as unknown' would be a better option because it will still show errors for any misspelling or mistake in the line.

In short, just don't use it at all unless you really have to and you are sure that the code will work as expected.
