Typescript has a special 'any' type that we can use whenever we don't know the exact type of a value. 

For example:

    let value: any;
    value = 5; // OK
    value = "Hello"; // OK
    value = true; // OK

The 'any' type is useful in situations where we are dealing with dynamic content, such as when working with external APIs or libraries that may not have type definitions.

But, remember that when you use 'any', it means we opt-out of type checking for a specific variable.

And this can be problematic because it allows any kind of value to be assigned to that variable, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.

Let's say we have this code - 

    let obj: any = { x : 0};

Since the type of 'obj' is 'any', it means we can do any of the following and it will still work -

    obj.foo();
    obj();
    obj.bar = 100;
    obj = "hello";
    const n: number = obj;

As it turns off the type checking for a variable, 'any' pretty much defeats the whole purpose of TypeScript, which is to provide a type-safe environment. And this also means that there are chances of Runtime errors in our code now. With 'any' we also lose any auto-completion and type inference benefits that TypeScript provides.

'any' should always be the last resort otherwise we should try to use more specific types or generics (we will know about this later) to maintain type safety.
