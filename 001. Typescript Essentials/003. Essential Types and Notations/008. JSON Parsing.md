Let's say we have a JSON string like this -

    '{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}'

To get the parsed data as a TypeScript object, we can do the following:

    const parsedData = JSON.parse('{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}');
    console.log(parsedData);

But, since we are using TypeScript, we know that if we do not specify the type of the parsed data, it will be inferred as 'any'. And indeed if you hover over 'parsedData' variable your ide will show something like this -

    const parsedData: any


Maybe we can tell the TypeScript that 'parse' here should return a specific object. Maybe like this -

    type User = {name: string, age: number}
    const parsedData = JSON.parse<User>('{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}');

Well, this will still not be valid because the ide will show an error saying -

    Expected 0 type arguments, but got 1

This means, we are not supposed to pass type arguments (whatever we passed between the < > brackets) to the 'parse' method. And if you hover over 'parse' method you will see that it does not have any < > brackets which means it cannot accept type arguments. So, this means some function will accept type arguments while some won't

But, since we want our 'parsedData' to have a specific type we can instead do this -

    const parsedData: User = JSON.parse('{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}');
