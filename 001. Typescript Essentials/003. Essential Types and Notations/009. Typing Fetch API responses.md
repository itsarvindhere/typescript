Let's talk about some async stuff now. 

We often use the 'Fetch' API to make HTTP requests and get data from a server

Something like this -

    async function fetchData() {
        const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
        const data = await response.json();

        return data;
    }

Here, we have an 'async' function in which we make an api call to a url and then get the response, get the data and return the data.

If you hover over the 'fetchData()' function, it will show this -

    function fetchData(): Promise<any>

This means, the function is returning a 'Promise' that resolves to 'any' type. Remember that 'any' is something that we should avoid using as much as possible, because it doesn't provide any type safety. Instead, we should try to define a proper type for the data we expect to receive from the API.

Let's say that we know the api call will return us a count or a number value as the data. So, why not simply tell TypeScript the same thing?

We cannot add any type argument to 'fetch' because it does not accept any. Same is the case with the response.json() method.

One way is to add a type to the function itself - 

    async function fetchData(): Promise<number> {
       // CODE
    }

While this works, there is one issue. While we told TypeScript that 'fetchData' returns a Promise which resolves to a number, inside the 'fetchData' function, if you hover over the 'data', it is still 'any'. That's because 'response.json' returns a Promise that resolves to 'any'.

So, another way is to add a type to 'data' instead -

    async function fetchData() {
        const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
        const data: number = await response.json();

        return data;
    }

And now, since we return 'data' which we have typed as 'number', typescript automatically infers the type for 'fetchData()' function has 'Promise<number>'. But, we can be more explicit and provide the type anyways -

    async function fetchData(): Promise<number> {
        const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
        const data: number = await response.json();

        return data;
    }
