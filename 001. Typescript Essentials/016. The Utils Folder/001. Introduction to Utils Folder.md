When it comes to application development in TypeScript, we usually have one side which is all about the application logic, while there is the other side which is all about the types which support the application logic.

Now, in almost every application, we will have some shared logic which is used in multiple places across the application. This shared logic can be utility functions, helper methods, or common constants that are used throughout the codebase. Usually, these are kept in some sort of 'utils' folder. This is like a toolbox that contains all the handy tools we might need while building our application.

In TypeScript, there are some techniques that we can use in such 'shared logic' scenarios to make our code more type-safe and maintainable.

So, in this section, we will explore how to effectively use a 'utils' folder in a TypeScript project. We will look at best practices for organizing utility functions, how to type them properly, and how to leverage TypeScript's features to enhance the usability and safety of our shared code.
