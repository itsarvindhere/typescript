Let's say we have this piece of code -

    const hasKey = (obj: object, key: string) => {
        return obj.hasOwnProperty(key);
    };

Here, we have a method 'hasKey' that checks if a given key exists in an object.

What we want is that we should be able to call it with different types of keys, such as strings, numbers, and symbol - 

    console.log(hasKey({foo: 'bar'}, 'foo'));
    console.log(hasKey({1: 'bar'}, 1));
    const id = Symbol();
    console.log(hasKey({[id]: 'bar'}, id));

The issue is that right now, this will show an error because the key parameter is typed as a string, but we are trying to pass a number and a symbol as the key.

Well, the simplest approach would be to simply use a union type here -

    const hasKey = (obj: object, key: string | number | symbol) => {
        return obj.hasOwnProperty(key);
    };

And now, we can call the 'hasKey' function with different types of keys without any TypeScript errors.

# The 'PropertyKey' Type

There is actually a global type in TypeScript that represents the data type of a property key. It can either be a string or a number or a symbol. That's exactly what we need here.

This is available globally so there is no need to import it. We can simply use it as -

    const hasKey = (obj: object, key: PropertyKey) => {
        return obj.hasOwnProperty(key);
    };
