So now, the main question is - What should we prefer? Types or Interfaces?

Well, a 'Type' can represent not only an object type but also primitive types, unions, and intersections. On the other hand, an interface is specifically designed for defining the shape of objects.

There are two main differences between a 'Type' and an 'Interface' in TypeScript when it comes to extending and modifying them.

The first difference is the way in which we extend them.

In case of types, we use the ampersand (&) to create an intersection type. For example:

    type Animal = {
        name: string;
    }

    type Bear = Animal & { 
        honey: boolean;
    }

We can use ampersand with interfaces as well but the result is a type, not an interface. For example:

    interface Animal {
        name: string;
    }

    type Bear = Animal & { 
        honey: boolean;
    }

On the other hand, in case of interfaces, to create a new interface which is a combination of two or more interfaces, we use the 'extends' keyword. For example:

    interface Animal {
        name: string;
    }

    interface Bear extends Animal {
        honey: boolean;
    }

Another difference between the two is in how we add new fields to existing types and interfaces. In case of types, it is not possible to change a type after it is created.

That is, if we have -

    type A = {
        title: string;
    }

We cannot re-declare the type 'A' in our code later with some new fields -

    type A = {
        width: number;
        height: number;
    }

This will throw an error in the IDE saying - Duplicate identifier 'A'.

On the other hand, if we have an interface -

    interface A {
        title: string;
    }

We can re-declare the interface 'A' later with new fields -

    interface A {
        width: number;
        height: number;
    }

Now, the interface 'A' has three fields - title, width, and height. This is because an interface is always extendable while a type cannot be re-opened to add new properties.

If you go over the official documentation of TypeScript, you will find that it says -

    For the most part, you can choose based on personal preference, and TypeScript will tell you if it needs something to be the other kind of declaration. If you would like a heuristic, use interface until you need to use features from type.
